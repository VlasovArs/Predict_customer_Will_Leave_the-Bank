# Predict_customer_Will_Leave_the-Bank (ANN)
The client's task is to find out which clients are more likely to leave the bank.

My solution: I analyzed, then processed the data, trained them on a neural network and got a forecast. The name of the target variable: "Excited".

Result: The client received a decision within a day, my forecast helped him to concentrate on these clients so that they would not leave the bank, thereby preserving profits.
